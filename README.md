- Description
	+ I wanted a single project that I can use to try different laravel features as I'm working my way through the Laravel documentation.
	+ auth has been implemented using bootstrap
	+ the project root route '/' contains links to view the output of the laravel features
	+ Each collection method documented has a route closure in routes/web.php
	+ Each relationship type has a route closure in routes/web.php
